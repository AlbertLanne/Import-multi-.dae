# Import-multi-.dae
Small script to import several .dae template at the same time on blender.
Go on blender and open the file with the text editor, change the path to the location where your models are .dae.
Do not forget to double all the slashes.

This script was created by me and ADinfo (Guillaume) hoping it can help you
